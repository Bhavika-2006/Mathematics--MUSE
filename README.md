**The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**

>The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality is a fundamental inequality in mathematics that finds applications in various fields, including linear algebra, calculus, probability theory, and statistics. Named after mathematicians Augustin-Louis Cauchy and Hermann Schwarz, this inequality provides an upper bound on the absolute value of the inner product (also known as the dot product) of two vectors.

```math
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
```
